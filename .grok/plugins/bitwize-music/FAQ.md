# FAQ

Answers to the questions I get most — what this project is, what it costs to
run, why the workflow is shaped the way it is, and where I stand on
third-party integrations.

## The project

### What is this?

A Claude Code plugin that turns a conversation into a full album production
pipeline — concept, research, lyrics, Suno prompts, mastering, promo, and
release prep, with quality gates at every stage. The [README](README.md) has
the full tour and an example workflow.

### How do I get started?

Install from the marketplace, then run setup and configure:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills
/plugin install bitwize-music@bitwize-music
/bitwize-music:setup
/bitwize-music:configure
```

New to the workflow? `/bitwize-music:tutorial` walks you through your first
album end to end.

### How do I contribute?

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the branch and PR workflow. Genre
documentation is a great first contribution — `/bitwize-music:genre-creator`
scaffolds one for you.

## Costs & requirements

### What do I need to run this?

- **Claude Code** on Linux or macOS (Windows works via WSL).
- **Python 3.11+** for the MCP server and audio tools.
- **A Claude subscription that can take the load.** This project pushes
  Claude Code hard — multi-agent research, sub-agent orchestration across
  model tiers. It works best on the Max subscription; Pro will hit rate
  limits during multi-track sessions.
- **A Suno account** for generation (see the next question).

### Do I need a paid Suno subscription?

For anything you plan to release, yes. Beyond generation limits, the
important part is rights: Suno ties commercial use of generated audio to its
paid subscriptions. If you intend to put tracks on streaming platforms, make
sure the subscription you generate under actually grants commercial use —
that grant is the foundation of your chain of rights (more on why that
matters
[below](#what-about-commercial-rights-this-is-the-part-that-worries-me)).

## Workflow philosophy

### Why do I generate on Suno manually instead of in-terminal?

Two different things are going on here, and it's worth separating them:

1. **The mechanical hop is temporary.** Clicking over to Suno's site, pasting
   the prompt, downloading stems, importing them — that's friction, not
   philosophy. Suno has no official public API today; the day one exists,
   I'll automate all of it (see
   [the integrations section](#integrations--third-party-services)).
2. **The listening is permanent.** Automating generation will never mean
   automating approval. No track advances until a human has actually listened
   and signed off — that gate stays even in a fully API-driven future. The
   pipeline automates everything around your judgment, not instead of it.

### Why does the pipeline require human source verification?

Documentary albums name real people and make factual claims. Every source
gets captured as a clickable link and a human verifies it before generation
is unblocked — `/bitwize-music:pre-generation-check` enforces the gate. I
won't ship a workflow where an LLM's research goes straight to publication
without a human signing off.

## Integrations & third-party services

### Will you integrate with Suno's API or MCP server?

The moment an official one exists, yes — enthusiastically. Generate,
regenerate, pull stems into the workspace, all without leaving the terminal.
What won't change: you still listen to every track before it's approved. An
API removes the busywork of the generation hop, not the listening gate —
that gate is load-bearing.

### Why won't you integrate third-party Suno-wrapper APIs?

Suno doesn't offer a public API, so services selling "Suno generation over
REST" are accessing Suno programmatically without affiliation — some say so
outright in their own terms. Shipping such an integration — even opt-in and
disabled by default — would make this project a distribution channel for
access the platform hasn't sanctioned. That's a line I can't cross, however
clean the PR is. (This came to a head in
[#465](https://github.com/bitwize-music-studio/claude-ai-music-skills/issues/465)
if you want the long version.)

### What about commercial rights? (This is the part that worries me.)

Walk the chain of rights for a track generated through a wrapper:

1. Suno's commercial-use grant attaches to **its subscribers, generating
   through its platform**.
2. A wrapper generates on your behalf — through whose account? Under whose
   subscription? Wrapper terms typically add **no license of their own**
   ("rights flow from Suno's terms") and disclaim IP warranties.
3. Suno's terms **don't contemplate the wrapper existing**, so there is no
   written grant that clearly reaches you.

The result is audio with no clear chain of rights — and if it gets released
and a claim or takedown comes, that risk lands entirely on the person who
released it. People use this plugin to put real albums on real streaming
platforms. I'm not handing them that gap.

(Even generating on Suno directly: confirm your subscription grants
commercial use before you release. This isn't legal advice — read the terms
yourself.)

### Can you support other music generation services?

In principle, yes. A provider running **its own model** behind **its own
official API** is a completely different story from a wrapper. The
architecture would be a provider-neutral interface with pluggable adapters —
the templates already carry `<!-- SERVICE: suno -->` markers anticipating
exactly this. One honest caveat: I don't hold subscriptions with other
providers, so a contributed adapter needs contributor-maintained testing to
be viable.
