# Sheet Music Publisher - Workflow Detail

Detailed workflow phases, error handling, tips, and tool reference for the sheet-music-publisher skill.

---

## Phase 1: Setup Verification

### Check AnthemScore

**macOS locations:**
```bash
# Check standard install
ls -l "/Applications/AnthemScore.app/Contents/MacOS/AnthemScore"

# Try Homebrew
which anthemscore
```

**Linux locations:**
```bash
which anthemscore
ls -l /usr/bin/anthemscore /usr/local/bin/anthemscore
```

**Windows locations:**
```
C:\Program Files\AnthemScore\AnthemScore.exe
C:\Program Files (x86)\AnthemScore\AnthemScore.exe
```

**If not found**, tell user:
```
AnthemScore not found. Install from: https://www.lunaverus.com/

Recommended edition: Professional ($42) - full editing + CLI
Free trial available: 30 seconds per song, 100 total transcriptions

After installing, run this command again.
```

### Check MuseScore

**macOS locations:**
```bash
ls -l "/Applications/MuseScore 4.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore"
ls -l "/Applications/MuseScore 3.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore"
```

**Linux locations:**
```bash
which mscore
ls -l /usr/bin/musescore /usr/local/bin/musescore
```

**Windows locations:**
```
C:\Program Files\MuseScore 4\bin\MuseScore4.exe
C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin\MuseScore3.exe
```

**If not found**, tell user:
```
MuseScore not found. Install from: https://musescore.org/

Free and open source. Required for:
- Polishing transcriptions
- Fixing titles (re-exporting PDFs)
- Manual editing

After installing, run this command again.
```

### Check Python Dependencies (Songbook Only)

If user wants to create a songbook, call `get_python_command()` to verify the venv exists, then check songbook deps:
```bash
{python_from_get_python_command} -c "import pypdf, reportlab"
```

**If missing:**
```
Songbook dependencies missing. Install with:

  ~/.bitwize-music/venv/bin/pip install pypdf reportlab

These are only needed for songbook creation (optional).
```

## Phase 2: Track Selection

**List mastered tracks:**
```bash
ls -1 {audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/*.wav
```

**Ask user which tracks to transcribe:**
```
Found N mastered WAV files.

Sheet music works best for:
✓ Melodic tracks (clear vocal/instrumental lines)
✓ Singer-songwriter, folk, acoustic
✓ Simple arrangements

Challenging:
⚠ Dense electronic music
⚠ Heavy distortion
⚠ Rapid rap vocals

Which tracks should I transcribe?
  1. All tracks
  2. Specific tracks (you'll select)
  3. Let me recommend based on metadata
```

**If user chooses option 3**, read track files from content directory to check for:
- Explicit vocal mentions in Suno Style Box
- Melodic genres (folk, country, singer-songwriter)
- Simple instrumentation descriptions

**Recommend tracks** that mention:
- "vocals", "singing", "melodic"
- "acoustic", "piano", "folk"
- Avoid: "aggressive", "distorted", "dense"

## Phase 3: Automated Transcription

**Run transcription via MCP:**
```
transcribe_audio(album_slug)
```

**The script will:**
1. Read config to locate audio files
2. Find AnthemScore based on OS
3. Create output directory: `{audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/sheet-music/source/`
4. Process each WAV (~30-60 seconds per track)
5. Generate PDF + MusicXML + MIDI for each track

**Monitor progress** and report to user:
```
Transcribing tracks...

✓ Track 01: ocean-of-tears.wav - Complete
  → sheet-music/source/01-ocean-of-tears.pdf
  → sheet-music/source/01-ocean-of-tears.xml
  → sheet-music/source/01-ocean-of-tears.mid

✓ Track 02: run-away.wav - Complete
  → sheet-music/source/02-run-away.pdf
  → sheet-music/source/02-run-away.xml
  → sheet-music/source/02-run-away.mid

Transcription complete: N tracks processed
```

## Phase 4: Quality Review & Polish

**After transcription completes**, recommend review:
```
Transcription complete. Generated PDFs are in:
  {audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/sheet-music/

Next: Review transcriptions for accuracy

Automated transcription accuracy: 70-95% depending on arrangement

Recommend polish in MuseScore?
  - Fix notation errors (wrong notes, durations)
  - Add dynamics (p, mf, f)
  - Adjust key/time signatures
  - Format for print

Options:
  1. Yes - I'll polish in MuseScore now (pause here)
  2. Skip - PDFs are good enough
  3. Only specific tracks need polish (which ones?)
```

**If user chooses polish:**
```
Opening MusicXML files in MuseScore for editing...

Polish checklist:
  [ ] Key signature correct
  [ ] Time signature correct
  [ ] Note durations correct
  [ ] Rests complete measures
  [ ] Dynamics added (p, mf, f)
  [ ] Tempo marking added
  [ ] Title/composer in score properties

After editing in MuseScore:
  1. File → Export → PDF (300 DPI)
  2. Save MuseScore project (.mscz)
  3. Tell me when done: "polish complete"

I'll wait for your confirmation before proceeding.
```

## Phase 5: Prepare Singles

**After polish (or if skipped)**, prepare consumer-ready singles via MCP:
```
prepare_singles(album_slug)
```

**What this does:**
- Reads numbered source files from `sheet-music/source/`
- Applies smart title casing (e.g., "01-ocean-of-tears" → "Ocean of Tears")
- Updates MusicXML `<work-title>` tags
- Writes clean-titled files to `sheet-music/singles/` (PDF, XML, MIDI)
- Creates `.manifest.json` for track ordering
- Source files are never modified

**Report:**
```
Preparing singles...

✓ Prepared 5 tracks in singles/
✓ Created .manifest.json

Files ready for website distribution.
```

## Phase 6: Songbook Creation (Optional)

**Ask user:**
```
Create a combined songbook PDF?

This creates a distribution-ready book with:
  - Title page (with album art if available)
  - Copyright page
  - Table of contents
  - All tracks in order

Perfect for:
  - Website distribution (free download)
  - Licensing packages
  - Fan resources

Create songbook? [Y/n]
```

**If yes, run via MCP:**
```
create_songbook(album_slug, title="{album_title} Songbook", page_size="letter")
```

**Detect page size from config:**
- Read `~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml` → `sheet_music.page_size`
- Default: `letter`

**Detect cover art:**
```bash
# Check standard location
ls -l {audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/album.png
```

**Report:**
```
Creating songbook...

✓ Found album art: album.png
✓ Songbook created: {album}/sheet-music/{Album}_Songbook.pdf

Contents:
  - Title page (with album art)
  - Copyright page
  - Table of contents (N tracks)
  - N tracks (XX pages total)

Ready for website distribution.
```

## Phase 7: Summary & Next Steps

**Final summary:**
```
✅ SHEET MUSIC GENERATION COMPLETE

Album: {album_name}
Tracks transcribed: N
Output: {audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/sheet-music/

Files generated:
  - N × PDF (individual tracks)

## Error Handling

### AnthemScore Not Found

**Error message:**
```
AnthemScore not detected on your system.

Install from: https://www.lunaverus.com/

Editions:
  - Lite: $31 (basic transcription, no editing)
  - Professional: $42 (full editing + CLI) ← Recommended
  - Studio: $107 (lifetime updates)

Free trial: 30 seconds per song, 100 total transcriptions

```

### MuseScore Not Found

**If only needed for title fixing:**
```
MuseScore not found. Options:

1. Install MuseScore (free): https://musescore.org/
   Then I'll fix titles and re-export PDFs

2. Skip title fixing
   PDFs will have track numbers in titles (e.g., "01 - Song Name")
   You can fix this manually later

Which option?
```

### No WAV Files Found

```
No WAV files found in: {audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/

Expected location based on config:
  audio_root: {audio_root}
  artist: {artist}
  album: {album}

Check:
  1. Album name spelled correctly?
  2. Audio files in correct location?
  3. Files are .wav format (not .mp3)?

Use /bitwize-music:import-audio to move files if needed.
```

### Python Dependencies Missing

```
Songbook dependencies missing. Install with:

  pip install pypdf reportlab

Note: Only needed for songbook creation. Individual PDFs are already generated.

Install and retry? [Y/n]
```

### Track Transcription Failed

**If AnthemScore returns error:**
```
⚠ Track failed: {track_name}

Possible causes:
  - File is corrupted or unreadable
  - Format not supported (use WAV)
  - AnthemScore license issue

Try:
  1. Verify file plays in audio player
  2. Re-export from DAW as WAV
  3. Check AnthemScore license status

Skip this track and continue? [Y/n]
```

## Tips for Better Results

### Audio Quality Matters

Tell user:
```
Better source = better transcription

Best practices:
  ✓ Use mastered WAV files (not MP3)
  ✓ Ensure no clipping
  ✓ Clear, well-mixed audio
  ✗ Avoid overly compressed audio
  ✗ Avoid heavy distortion
```

### When to Recommend Stem Separation

**If user has dense/complex tracks**, suggest:
```
For complex arrangements, stem separation can improve accuracy:

1. Install Demucs: pip install demucs
2. Separate stems: demucs {track.wav}
3. Transcribe vocals.wav and other.wav separately
4. Combine in MuseScore

Use for:
  - Dense rock/pop arrangements
  - Buried melodies
  - Professional licensing needs

Skip for:
  - Simple acoustic tracks
  - Quick reference sheets

Want to try stem separation? [y/N]
```

### Piano Reduction Philosophy

**If user asks about transcription approach:**
```
AnthemScore creates "piano reduction" - a playable piano arrangement.

It captures:
  ✓ Main melody
  ✓ Bass line
  ✓ Harmonic structure
  ✓ Characteristic riffs

It simplifies/omits:
  ✗ Drum patterns
  ✗ Doubled/layered parts
  ✗ Complex backgrounds
  ✗ Sound effects

Goal: Playable by intermediate pianist, captures song essence
```

## Integration with Main Workflow

**When to proactively offer this skill:**

1. **After album mastering complete:**
   - User says "mastering done"
   - All tracks marked `Final`
   → Ask: "Want to generate sheet music for this album?"

2. **User mentions licensing:**
   - "I want to license this"
   - "preparing licensing package"
   → Suggest: "Sheet music is valuable for sync licensing. Generate now?"

3. **User mentions publishing or distribution:**
   - "distribute sheet music"
   - "create a songbook"
   → Invoke this skill automatically

**Position in workflow:**
```
Generate → Master → [Sheet Music] → Release
                        ↑
                   Optional enhancement
```

## Config Integration

**Always read config first:**
```bash
cat ~/.bitwize-music/config.yaml
```

**Extract values:**
- `artist.name` → For songbook metadata
- `paths.audio_root` → Where mastered audio lives
- `paths.content_root` → Where album metadata is
- `urls.soundcloud` (or other) → For website field in songbook
- `sheet_music.page_size` → For songbook dimensions (default: letter)
- `sheet_music.section_headers` → Whether to add section headers (default: false)

**Path construction:**
```
Input audio:  {audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/*.wav
Output:       {audio_root}/artists/{artist}/albums/{genre}/{album}/sheet-music/
```
